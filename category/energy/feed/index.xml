					<description><![CDATA[All these factors should be taken into account. A risk-aware Windows user can probably survive without any anti-virus software at all. I ran Windows XP for a year to try to prove it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead lighter">It’s complicated. I’ve spent more than 20 years recommending various anti-virus programs as an essential part of any Windows setup. However, Windows has changed, and the threat landscape has changed. I am no longer sure that a third-party AV program is essential, and some of them may be detrimental. Of course, needs vary.</p>
<p>Some people are more accident-prone than others, and some are less sensitive to threats. Some venture into riskier parts of the internet. Some need to protect very valuable information. All these factors should be taken into account. A risk-aware Windows user can probably survive without any anti-virus software at all. I ran Windows XP for a year to try to prove it. Less knowledgeable users can get their PCs infected no matter how much protection you give them.</p>
<ul>
<li>That’s no longer the case</li>
<li>Today’s malware is written by professionals</li>
<li>They are less interested in virusest</li>
<li>They are interested in collecting financial information</li>
<li>They know they can blackmail people into paying for something</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sofware can’t protect people from themselves</h5>
<p>Some need to protect very valuable information. All these factors should be taken into account. A risk-aware Windows user can probably survive without any anti-virus software at all. I ran Windows XP for a year to try to prove it. Less knowledgeable users can get their PCs infected no matter how much protection you give them. Software can’t protect people from themselves.</p>
